# increasing sequence

Given a sequence of integers as an array we must determine whether if it is possible to obtain an increasing sequence by removing one or less elements from an array. Return value should be a boolean.

Notes:
it does not have to be 1,2,3,4,5.
it can be 10, 20, 30. The goal is that it is increasing only.

input = [1,1]
output = true

input = [1,2,6,7,5]
output = true

input = [1,1,3,5,8,8]
output = false
