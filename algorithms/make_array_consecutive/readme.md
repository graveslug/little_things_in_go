# Make a Consecutive Array

Take an unodered non-negative integar array and organize it from smallest to largest. If there are missing numbers figure out how many additional numbers we need.

ex
inputArray = [5, 3, 8, 4]
output = 4
missing 1, 2, 6, 7

ex2
inputArray = [0, 3]
output = 2
missing = 1, 2
